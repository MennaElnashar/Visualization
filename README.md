# Visualization
A data visualization project on two different datasets

The first dataset googleplaystore.csv is about google play store apps including their ratings, number of reviews, genres, type, and number of installs.

The second dataset country_wise_latest.csv is about COVID 19 and it includes the number of active, recovered, and death cases in addition to their region.

In this project, I used different Python libraries to create different static and interactive visualizations that help the user understand the data in an easy way.

Data Visualization Project.ipynb is the Python Notebook of the project and I suggest running it on your own computer to see the interactive visuals.
