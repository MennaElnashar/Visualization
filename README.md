# Visualization

This project focuses on data visualization using two different datasets: Google Play Store Apps and COVID 19. 

The "googleplaystore.csv" dataset provides information about various apps available on the Google Play Store, such as their ratings, number of reviews, genres, type (free or paid), and number of installs.

The "country_wise_latest.csv" dataset contains data related to COVID-19, including the number of active cases, recovered cases, and deaths, categorized by different regions.

To create the visualizations, this project utilizes various Python libraries that specialize in data visualization. These libraries may include but are not limited to Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Pandas.

The project generates a range of static and interactive visualizations by employing these tools. These visualizations aid users in comprehending the data more easily and provide insights into patterns, trends, and relationships present within the datasets.

To explore the project further, you can access the Python Notebook titled "Data Visualization Project.ipynb". Running this notebook on your own computer will enable you to interact with the visualizations and gain a deeper understanding of the data.
